# Rockfield Tennis Club

Site description:
This is largely modelled on st. anne's tennis club website but with various preferences about content etc. You may be able to get a sense of some things from their website: https://www.stannesparktennis.com


Overall I want to cleanup the content on the current site (I have reproduced and tidied it a little below and tried to move it to the appropriate section in the reorganized site). The theme can be nice and simple with the blue and orange colours of our club (see club logo).
The site should be responsive and mobile friendly in a maintainable way. Sacrifice sexiness for maintainability.

## HOME
Complete redesign for this. Background pictures are not necessary like St. Anne's, content should not be repetitive. Don't take up space unnecessarily like current site where "Rockfield tennis club" is repeated over and over along with the logo.

Approximate contents: Welcome message, why rockfield? (this should be carefully chosen icons), Booking a court (links to join as a member, public play, and add opening hours), Contact (link to about page)


# OLD site content

This is the content of the old site with some tidying up. It's here for convenience and speed things up. The old site shouldn't really be used as a model of what I want so it's mainly just a task of reorganizing the content below into the structure above (in the appropriate markdown files with internal linking, the newsletters are probably an exception, we should use html files for those )

## TODO: Little fixes required to this old content
- student membership not an option but mentioned
- team matchplay isn't explained

### October Newsletter



[Source: https://rockfieldtennisclub.ie/october-newsletter/](https://rockfieldtennisclub.ie/october-newsletter/)



**Members, we hope you are keeping well and in good Tennis spirit coming into the winter months!! Here is a quick catch up on Rockfield!!**



**Captains Update**



**Men’s DLTC League**



**Senior League**



Rockfield entered a strong team in the men's over 45 senior league and did really well against some of the biggest clubs in Dublin.



**Floodlit League**



The men have also entered two teams in the Floodlight League: one in Class 4 and one in Class 6. The fact that DLTC graded us as a Class 4 standard demonstrates the progress the club has made in 2023 has been clearly noticed.



The Men’s 1st team have qualified for the playoffs, and the Men’s 2nd team have qualified for the Quarterfinals, which means promotion to class 5 next year.



**Ladies DLTC League**



**Senior League**



Rockfield entered 2 ladies teams into the over 35 Senior League, 1 in class 6 and 1 in class 7. Both teams had a super campaign and made it to the Quarterfinals.



Making it this far secured a promotion to class 5/class 6 for both teams, which is a fantastic achievement. Congratulations to all the ladies involved.



**Floodlit League**



Rockfield has entered 2 ladies teams into the Floodlit League, 1 in class 5 & 1 in class 6.



This was the first time our ladies 1st team entered into class 5, and they have done a great job. They finished mid-table, so will remain at this class next year, which is great.



Our ladies 2nd team have had a super campaign so far and have qualified for Quarterfinals, which means promotion to class 5 next year! Well done to all the ladies involved, super achievement.



**New Opening Hours**

**Rockfield Tennis Club Court Etiquette**



Did you see our new Court Etiquette signs at the entrance of courts 1 & 2 and courts 3 & 4? Be sure to take 2 mins next time you're down to have a read. A full list of all our policies can be found on the link below:



[https://rockfieldtennisclub.ie/policies/](https://rockfieldtennisclub.ie/policies/)



**DCC Update**



As discussed at the AGM, Rockfield Tennis Club would benefit greatly from improved communication with Dublin City Council (DCC) staff. The city council owns our tennis club and the associated property. Rockfield members benefit from this arrangement because they are able to use the facilities, which are jointly maintained by the management committee and the city council. In this situation, typically the club would obtain a licence to maintain the facilities.



The current management committee has been working with DCC to get a new licence in place, improve communication on court maintenance, and develop the facilities. Members of the management committee met with key people from DCC to discuss development of the facilities. Some key points from this interaction are listed below.



- For short-term development of the current facilities, we coordinated with DCC on an application for a sports grant to fund converting the hard courts to a premium surface and installing flood lights around them.



- We have begun to iterate on a draft licence to formalise our mutually beneficial relationship with DCC.



- We have also started to discuss the revival of the plans for a new pavilion that was originally drawn up/approved in 2015. Support from local councillors will be key in bringing this development about. We have invited our local councillors to our 40th anniversary celebration to show them how the community and facilities at our club have grown and flourished over recent years.



We will continue to communicate key developments in our relationship with DCC to members.

**Best of luck and thanks to Jay**



At the start of this month, one of our beloved Pavilion attendants finished working in Rockfield. Jay had started with us in 2020, during the Covid Crisis, and helped us greatly in the time he was with us. Jay made sure the tennis club was as safe, friendly, and welcoming as could be, and he will be missed greatly. Jason was always around for a laugh, and we wish him the very best in his future.



**Happy 40th Anniversary RTC**



We will be celebrating 40 years of tennis in Rockfield TC on Saturday the 18th November, 2023, and the management committee would like to invite you to join us for these celebrations on that day from 2 – 4 pm in the club.



There will be a short presentation on the story of Rockfield Tennis Club along with an update on our plans for its future development.



Also, a plaque will be unveiled to mark this auspicious occasion.



There will be lots of tennis on the day for both adults and children, and refreshments will be served.



So put the date in your diary with more details to follow on ‘Rockfield Announcements’.



**Rolling back the years by Jean Ryan & Pauline McEvoy (2 founding members still playing tennis in RTC)**



We arrived into our newly built housing estate in 1975 and were busy raising our families. Rockfield park was just a big empty field. In 1983, there was great excitement as
